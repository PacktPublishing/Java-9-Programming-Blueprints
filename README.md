It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Java is a powerful language that has applications in a wide variety of fields. Right from playing games on your computer to performing banking transactions, Java is at the heart of everything.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All the code files are present in their respective code folders. Chapter01 and Chapter12 do not contain any code files.

The code will look like the following:
```
public interface Speaker {
  void saySomething(String message);
}
public class SpeakerImpl implements Speaker {
  public void saySomething(String message) {
    System.out.println(message);
  }
}
```

You need the Java Development Kit (JDK) 9, NetBeans 8.2 or newer, and Maven 3.0 or newer. Some chapters will require additional software, including Scene Builder from Gluon and Android Studio.
